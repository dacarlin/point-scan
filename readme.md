# Scan possible point mutants of an enzyme and report features 

Layout: 

Input structures:

+ PDB structure of enzyme 
+ enzdes-style constraint file detailing ideal catalytic constraints 
+ ligand params files 

iPython notebook: 

+ will make a nice list for you of all the possible point mutants of your protein 
+ submits them as SGE jobs (Slurm?) 
+ analyze FeaturesReporter data 
+ machine learning
